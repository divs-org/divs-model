## Overview

The **DIVS** model is a lightweight agile process methodology designed for startups with smaller teams. It centers around the "**Design**, **Iterate**, **Validate**, and **Ship**" stages of doing software development. This is the methodology used in [Alphaus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alphaus/), a Tokyo-based startup.

## Principles

These are the principles that the DIVS model follows:

* The process should "feel" lightweight.
* The core part of the process should be generic enough to be tweaked within a team.
* Releases should be smaller, incremental, and frequent.
* Weekly, monthly, and quarterly checkpoints are important for alignment.
* The process doesn't enforce any style of communication.
* The process doesn't enforce any specific development methods within each stage.

## The model

The DIVS model centers around the four DIVS stages, views, checkpoints, and initiatives.

### The DIVS stages

**Design** - This is the first stage of DIVS. The expected output of this stage is a design document (or **DD**). DIVS doesn't provide any format.

**Iterate** - The implementation iterations of the DD. The expected output is a version of the working code.

**Validate** - This stage validates the output version of the previous stage against the DD. This stage provides feedback to the code version being validated.

**Ship** - Ensure production readiness of the working code. The expected output is the updated DD, production version, and documentation.

### Views

TBD.

### Checkpoints

## FAQ

**What's with the name?**

While it means `Design`, `Iterate`, `Validate`, and `Ship`, it is also a play-on-word to the `div` html element which is usually used for grouping or organizing.
