## Overview

The **DIVS** model is a lightweight agile process methodology designed for startups with smaller teams. It centers around the "**Design**, **Iterate**, **Validate**, and **Ship**" stages of doing software development. This is the methodology used in [Alphaus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alphaus/), a Tokyo-based startup.

## Principles

These are the principles that the DIVS model follows:

* The process should "feel" lightweight.
* The core part of the process should be generic enough to be tweaked within a team.
* Releases should be smaller, incremental, and frequent.
* Weekly, monthly, and quarterly checkpoints are important for alignment.
* The process doesn't enforce any style of communication.
* The process doesn't enforce any specific development methods within each stage.

## The model

The DIVS model centers around the four DIVS stages, views, checkpoints, and initiatives.

### The DIVS stages

**Design** - This is the first stage of DIVS. The expected output of this stage is a design document (or **DD**). DIVS doesn't provide any format. It is optional for bug fixes, unless it changes the original design significantly, then it should contain both the details of the issue and the design of the proposed solution.

**Iterate** - The implementation iterations of the DD. The expected output is a version of the working code.

**Validate** - This stage validates the output version of the previous stage against the DD. This stage provides feedback to the code version being validated.

**Ship** - Ensure production readiness. This covers testing, security, scaling, observability, etc. Output is the updated `DD`, production version and documentation.

### Views

TBD.

### Checkpoints

TBD.

## FAQ

**What's with the name?**

While it means `Design`, `Iterate`, `Validate`, and `Ship`, it is also a play-on-word to the `div` html element which is usually used for grouping or organizing.
