## Overview

The `DIVS` model is a simple agile process model designed for startups with smaller teams. It follows the `Design`, `Iterate`, `Validate`, and `Ship` stages in doing software development. This is the process model used in [Alphaus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alphaus/), a Tokyo-based startup.

## Principles

These are some of the guiding principles that that `DIVS` model follows:

* The process should "feel" lightweight.
* The process should be generic enough to be tailored or tweaked within a team.
* Releases should be smaller, incremental, and frequent.
* Weekly, monthly, and quarterly checkpoints are important for alignment.

## The model

**Design**

Design is essential. The output of this stage is a design document (DD). It is optional for bug fixes, unless it changes the original design significantly then it should contain both the details of the issue and the design of the proposed solution.

## FAQ

**What's with the name?**

While it means `Design`, `Iterate`, `Validate`, and `Ship`, it is also a play-on-word to the `div` html element which is usually used for grouping or organizing.
