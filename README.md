## Overview

The `DIVS` model is a simple agile process model designed for startups with smaller teams. It follows the `Design`, `Iterate`, `Validate`, and `Ship` stages in doing software development. This is the process model used in [Alphaus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alphaus/).

## Principles

The `DIVS` model stands on these principles:

* The process should "feel" lightweight and generic enough to be tailored or tweaked within each team.
* Releases should be smaller, incremental, and frequent.
*
