## Overview

The `DIVS` model is a simple agile process model designed for startups with smaller teams. It follows the `Design`, `Iterate`, `Validate`, and `Ship` stages in doing software development. This is the process model used in [Alphaus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alphaus/), a Tokyo-based startup.

## Principles

These are some of the guiding principles that that `DIVS` model follows:

* The process should "feel" lightweight.
* The process should be generic enough to be tailored or tweaked within a team.
* Releases should be smaller, incremental, and frequent.
* Weekly, monthly, and quarterly checkpoints are important for alignment.

## FAQ

**Why is it called `DIVS`?**

While it means `Design`, `Iterate`, `Validate`, and `Ship`, it is also a play-on-word to the `div` html element which is usually used for grouping or organizing.
